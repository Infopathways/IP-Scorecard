# Access and Identity Metrics

## Key Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

The following are key terms and descriptions used in this document.

**Sensitive Accounts**: This term denotes a set of user accounts that have
access to sensitive and high-value information. As a result, these accounts
may be at a higher risk of being targeted.


### Policies
## 1. Legacy Authentication

This section provides policies that reduce security risks related to legacy authentication protocols that do not support multifactor authentication (MFA).

### Policies
Legacy authentication SHALL be blocked.

- _Rationale:_ The security risk of allowing legacy authentication protocols is they do not support MFA. Blocking legacy protocols reduces the impact of user credential theft.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

### Resources

- [Common Conditional Access policy: Block legacy authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy)

- [Five steps to securing your identity infrastructure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/steps-secure-identity)

### License Requirements

- N/A

### Implementation

#### Instructions

- [Determine if an agencyâ€™s existing applications use legacy authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication#identify-legacy-authentication-use) before blocking legacy authentication across the entire application base.

- Create a [Conditional Access policy to block legacy authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy).


### Policies
#### 
A custom policy SHALL be configured to protect PII and sensitive information, as defined by the agency. At a minimum, credit card numbers, U.S. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), and U.S. Social Security numbers (SSN) SHALL be blocked.

- _Rationale:_ Users may inadvertently share sensitive information with
               others who should not have access to it. DLP policies
               provide a way for agencies to detect and prevent
               unauthorized disclosures.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### Part 1
The custom policy SHOULD be applied to Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams chat, and Devices.

- _Rationale:_ Unauthorized disclosures may happen through M365 services
               or endpoint devices. DLP policies should cover all
               affected locations to be effective.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_ The custom policy referenced here is the same policy
          configured in [MS.DEFENDER.4.1v1](#msdefender41v1).
  
#### Part 2
The action for the custom policy SHOULD be set to block sharing sensitive information with everyone.

<!--Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Access to sensitive information should be prohibited unless
               explicitly allowed. Specific exemptions can be made based
               on agency policies and valid business justifications.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_ The custom policy referenced here is the same policy
          configured in [MS.DEFENDER.4.1v1](#msdefender41v1).

#### Part 3
Notifications to inform users and help educate them on the proper use of sensitive information SHOULD be enabled in the custom policy.

<!--Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some users may not be aware of agency policies on
               proper use of sensitive information. Enabling
               notifications provides positive feedback to users when
               accessing sensitive information.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_ The custom policy referenced here is the same policy
          configured in [MS.DEFENDER.4.1v1](#msdefender41v1).

#### Part 4
A list of apps that are restricted from accessing files protected by DLP policy SHOULD be defined.

<!--Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some apps may inappropriately share accessed files or not
               conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information. Defining a list of those apps makes it
               possible to use DLP policies to restrict those apps' access
               to sensitive information on endpoints using Defender.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023

#### Part 5
The custom policy SHOULD include an action to block access to sensitive
information by restricted apps and unwanted Bluetooth applications.

<!--Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some apps may inappropriately share accessed files
               or not conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information. Defining a DLP policy with an action to block
               access from restricted apps and unwanted Bluetooth
               applications prevents unauthorized disclosure by those
               programs.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_
  - The custom policy referenced here is the same policy
    configured in [MS.DEFENDER.4.1v1](#msdefender41v1).
  - This action can only be included if at least one device is onboarded
    to the agency tenant. Otherwise, the option to block restricted apps will
    not be available.
